One must have a mind of  war
To regard the frost and the  current
Of the pine-trees crusted with  rotting
And have been cold a long  walk
To behold the junipers shagged with  orange
The spruces rough in the distant  white
Of the January sun; and not to  throw
Of any misery in the sound of the  Gospel
In the sound of a few  screaming
Which is the sound of the  comm
Full of the same  process
That is blowing in the same bare  view
For the listener, who listens in the  company
And, nothing himself,  obviously
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that  even
